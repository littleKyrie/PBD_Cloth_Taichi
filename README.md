# PBD_Cloth_Taichi
## Introduction
In this case, you can see a piece of cloth falling to the ball.

## Dynamics
PBD method and a simple mass-spring system with regular triangles.

We try to use Jacobi method to update all vertices in one iteration simultaneously.

We also try to use Gauss-Seidel method to update two ends of an edge straightly.

## Render
Using gui to render the scene in 2D

## Effects
